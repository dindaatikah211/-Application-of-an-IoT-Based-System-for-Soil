# flutter_tubes_iot

A Flutter application for **real-time soil and environmental monitoring** using an IoT system based on **ESP32**, multiple sensors, and MQTT connectivity.

## Getting Started

This project implements an **IoT-based soil monitoring system** that displays:

- 🌱 **Soil moisture**
- 🌡️ **Soil temperature**
- 🌬️ **Ambient temperature and humidity**
- 🌦️ **Rainfall status**
- 🌤️ **Light intensity**

It receives data from ESP32 via **MQTT protocol**, visualizes it in real time, and provides **AI-based feedback** to support **precision agriculture, smart farming, and environmental monitoring**.
